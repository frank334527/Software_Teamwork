# Knowledge Runtime

First-class RAG/deepdoc runtime (formerly `services/knowledge/vendor/ragflow-runtime`).
The Knowledge **contract adapter** lives separately in `services/knowledge/cmd/adapter`.

## Processes (Tier 2 split)

| Process | Port | Entry | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| runtime API | `127.0.0.1:9380` | `api/ragflow_server.py` | Dataset/document/search HTTP API |
| runtime worker | n/a | `rag/svr/task_executor.py` | deepdoc parse, chunk, embed (Redis queue) |

Both share PostgreSQL (`knowledge_system`), MinIO (`software-teamwork-knowledge`),
a supported doc engine such as Elasticsearch, and Redis.
The upstream RAGFlow MCP server/client product surface is intentionally not part
of this runtime; the project-owned Knowledge MCP bridge lives in
`services/knowledge`.

## Local development

Requires Python 3.13 + [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
cd services/knowledge-runtime
uv sync --python 3.13 --frozen
export PYTHONPATH=.
set -a && . ../../deploy/.env && set +a
# Edit conf/service_conf.yaml hosts for localhost (postgres, redis, minio, es).
# Start a host/external Elasticsearch for DOC_ENGINE=elasticsearch.
# Set KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_EMBEDDING_FACTORY/MODEL/BASE_URL and
# KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_MODEL_API_KEY before enabling ingestion.

# Terminal 1 — API
./deploy/api/run-local.sh

# Terminal 2 — worker
./deploy/worker/run-local.sh
```

Adapter (separate module):

```bash
cd services/knowledge
set -a && . ../../deploy/.env && set +a
go run ./cmd/adapter
```

## Configuration

- Local dev: edit `conf/service_conf.yaml` and point hosts at localhost
- Runtime auth: tenant-scoped API routes require `X-Service-Token` matching
  `KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_SERVICE_TOKEN`; the Go adapter sends
  `VENDOR_RUNTIME_SERVICE_TOKEN`.
- Object storage: root `minio-init` creates both `software-teamwork-local`
  (File service) and `software-teamwork-knowledge` (Knowledge runtime).
- Model credentials: set `KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_MODEL_API_KEY` in your local shell or
  untracked env file. Use `KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_EMBEDDING_FACTORY`,
  `KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`,
  `KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_RERANK_FACTORY`, `KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_RERANK_MODEL`, and
  `KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_RERANK_BASE_URL` to select external embedding/rerank
  providers without editing committed config. The startup scripts fail fast if
  the selected doc engine or embedding provider is not configured.
