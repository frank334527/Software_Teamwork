## Session 2: QA to AI Gateway smoke

**Date**: 2026-06-30
**Task**: QA to AI Gateway smoke
**Branch**: `JerryTeam/test/qa-ai-gateway-smoke`

### Summary

Implemented issue #288 with an env-gated QA to AI Gateway chat smoke, token/profile negative probes, operator runbook, and reusable backend smoke-test guidance; verified QA tests and builds.

### Main Changes

- Added an opt-in QA-to-AI-Gateway completion smoke beside the production model client.
- Covered a valid completion, invalid service token, and missing profile while keeping ordinary CI offline.
- Documented runtime variables, controlled-provider and real-provider execution, expected output, and troubleshooting.
- Captured the reusable environment-gated cross-service smoke contract in the backend quality guidelines.

## Session 3: Fix PR 300 review findings

**Date**: 2026-06-30
**Task**: Fix PR 300 review findings
**Branch**: `JerryTeam/test/qa-ai-gateway-smoke`

### Summary

Addressed both Codex findings for PR #300, completed Trellis audit records, and synchronized the branch with the latest develop.

### Main Changes

- Changed the missing-profile probe to use the request-scoped smoke ID instead of deriving a predictable name from the configured valid profile.
- Completed the archived issue #288 implementation/check context with the backend specs and smoke-design research actually used.
- Replaced the issue #288 journal placeholders with concrete changes and verification evidence.
- Extended the backend cross-service smoke contract with a unique missing-resource identifier rule.
- Rebased PR #300 onto the latest upstream/develop before archival.
