# Issue #125 MCP and Cross-Service Smoke

This runbook is the single entry point for S-008 / issue #125 smoke execution.
It composes existing targeted smoke tests without claiming that unavailable
provider, Knowledge runtime, Docker, or seed dependencies passed.

## Start Local Stack

Use the local integration baseline first:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
./scripts/local/dev-up.sh
./scripts/local/run-backend.sh
```

Docker only starts the infrastructure services listed in
`deploy/docker-compose.yml`: `postgres`, `redis`, `qdrant`, `minio`, and
`minio-init`. Auth, File, Knowledge, AI Gateway, QA, Document, and
Gateway run on the host through `run-backend.sh`; do not use Compose profiles,
business-service containers, or `--build` for this smoke.

For mainland China networks, keep the pinned registry rewrite, `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX`,
`GOPROXY`, and `GOSUMDB` defaults copied from `deploy/.env.example`. If image
pulls, Knowledge runtime dependency downloads, or Go module downloads are blocked, use
[`Docker 基础设施镜像拉取环境`](./docker-image-pull-environment.md) and record the
blocked dependency instead of marking the full smoke as passed.

## Common Environment

`scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh` reads `deploy/.env` when it exists, without
overriding variables already exported in the shell. The script derives the
default Gateway, owner-service, AI Gateway, Redis, admin, and Document MCP
settings from that file and the standard host-run ports.

Set per-run overrides only when the environment differs from the local baseline.
For example, set `GATEWAY_BASE_URL`, `FILE_SERVICE_BASE_URL`,
`KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_BASE_URL`, `QA_SERVICE_BASE_URL`,
`DOCUMENT_SERVICE_BASE_URL`, `GATEWAY_SMOKE_USERNAME`, or
`GATEWAY_SMOKE_PASSWORD` before invoking the script.

AI Gateway profile/provider prerequisites are still owned by #234. The local
`default-chat` / `local-placeholder-chat` seed only proves profile bootstrap;
real QA answers require a reachable OpenAI-compatible provider or controlled
stub profile.

## Smoke Commands

List slices:

```bash
bash scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh --list
```

Run the Auth/Gateway/Redis baseline:

```bash
bash scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh --auth
```

Run the full issue #352 Auth/Gateway/Redis smoke, including infra startup,
Auth migration apply, host-run Auth/Gateway processes, Gateway user creation,
Redis token-cache safety, logout invalidation, and fake owner-service header
capture:

```bash
bash scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh --auth-full
# equivalent:
bash scripts/run_issue_352_smoke.sh
```

The full smoke starts only `postgres` and `redis` from the root Compose file.
Business services still run on the host. If Docker is unavailable, image pulls
are blocked, PostgreSQL/Redis never become healthy, or Go is unavailable, the
script exits with a `blocked:` reason instead of reporting a business failure.
Optional CI is available through the manual workflow
`Auth Gateway Redis Smoke` (`.github/workflows/auth-gateway-redis-smoke.yml`);
it is not a required PR check.

Run File owner-service E2E:

```bash
bash scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh --file-owner
```

To exercise the File dependency failure branch, start Knowledge with
`FILE_SERVICE_BASE_URL` pointing at an unavailable File endpoint or with a
deliberately wrong File service token, then run:

```bash
export FILE_OWNER_E2E_EXPECT_FILE_FAILURE=1
bash scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh --file-owner
```

Do not use a request header or Gateway override to change the owner-service File
dependency for a single request; the failure branch must reflect the actual
service configuration being diagnosed.

Run QA MCP RAG:

```bash
bash scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh --qa-rag
```

The command always validates Gateway, QA, Knowledge, login, and knowledge-base
availability. Message-sending QA RAG assertions require a real AI Gateway
provider profile; enable them explicitly:

```bash
export QA_MCP_RAG_REAL_PROVIDER=1
export AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8086
bash scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh --qa-rag
```

Run Document REST:

```bash
bash scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh --document-rest
```

Run Document MCP report tools:

```bash
bash scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh --document-mcp
```

The Document MCP slice defaults to `MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable_http`,
`MCP_SERVER_ALIAS=document`, `${DOCUMENT_SERVICE_BASE_URL}/mcp`, and the local
Document MCP service token from `deploy/.env`. Override the `MCP_SERVER_*`
variables only when testing a non-default endpoint.

Run all slices:

```bash
bash scripts/run_issue_125_smoke.sh --all
```

## Coverage Matrix

| Slice | Gate | Verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth/Gateway/Redis | `AUTH_GATEWAY_REDIS_SMOKE=1` | Gateway login, `/users/me`, spoofed header rejection, logout invalidation, Redis `gateway:session:*` TTL/value safety. |
| Auth/Gateway/Redis full | `AUTH_GATEWAY_REDIS_FULL_SMOKE=1` | Auth migration apply, host-run Auth/Gateway startup, Gateway `POST /api/v1/users`, `/api/v1/sessions`, `/api/v1/users/me`, logout invalidation, Redis TTL/value/token safety, and fake owner capture of Gateway-injected `X-Caller-Service`, `X-Service-Token`, `X-User-Id`, roles, and permissions. |
| File owner E2E | `FILE_OWNER_E2E_SMOKE=1` | Gateway -> Knowledge -> File upload/read, Gateway -> Document read paths, File internal missing-token rejection, optional File dependency failure envelope, and public-response no-leak checks. |
| QA MCP RAG | `QA_MCP_RAG_SMOKE=1` | Knowledge tool availability, QA SSE `tool.completed` / `citation.delta` / `answer.completed`, safe tool-call summary, citation snapshots, final answer evidence. |
| Document REST | `DOCUMENT_REST_SMOKE=1` | Gateway -> Document report type/report/outlines routes, 404 envelope, and no-leak checks. |
| Document MCP | `QA_DOCUMENT_MCP_SMOKE=1` | Document Streamable HTTP MCP tools/list, `document__*` prefixing, generation status/result/export, `reportArtifact`, permission-denied summary, optional Gateway file download. |

## Failure Rules

- Public business requests must go through Gateway `/api/v1/**`.
- Smoke failures should include request ids such as `req_*_smoke_*`; search
  Gateway and owner-service logs by that id.
- Do not paste bearer tokens, service tokens, API keys, File object keys,
  bucket names, MinIO URLs, full prompts, full MCP arguments, or raw MCP
  results into issue comments or reports.
- If a capability is not ready, the smoke should be `skipped`, `expected
  failure`, or `blocked` with the missing dependency. Do not fake a pass.

## Common Triage

| Stage | Likely failure | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth/Gateway/Redis | `redis is not reachable` | Check `docker compose ps redis`, `GATEWAY_REDIS_ADDR`, and `NO_PROXY`. |
| Auth/Gateway/Redis full | `blocked: auth migration apply failed` | Check PostgreSQL is healthy, `AUTH_GATEWAY_REDIS_DATABASE_URL` points at the Auth database, and `deploy/postgres/init/001-create-databases.sql` ran for a fresh volume. |
| Auth/Gateway/Redis full | `blocked: postgres/redis infrastructure did not become healthy` | Check Docker daemon state, registry rewrite/image pulls, and `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file deploy/.env ps`. |
| File owner | `no knowledge bases available` | Run local seed or create a knowledge base through Gateway first. |
| Knowledge runtime | Runtime dependency preparation or startup fails | Check Knowledge runtime API/worker logs, `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX`, `VENDOR_RUNTIME_URL`, and runtime prerequisites; record the blocked dependency if it cannot be prepared. |
| Go services | Go module download fails during host-run startup | Check the relevant `.local/logs/*.log` for `proxy.golang.org` timeout and confirm `deploy/.env` contains `GOPROXY` / `GOSUMDB`; record network blockage only after those defaults are present. |
| QA RAG | AI Gateway/provider unavailable | Check #234 profile seed/provider setup; placeholder profiles are not real provider proof. |
| Document MCP | `initialize MCP session` / unauthorized | Check Document `/mcp`, `MCP_SERVER_TOKEN`, `DOCUMENT_MCP_SERVICE_TOKEN`, and token header. |
